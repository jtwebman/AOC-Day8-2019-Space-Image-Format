# Advent of Code - Day 8 - 2019: Space Image Format

This is my [Advent of Code day 8 solution](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/8).

Code here: [/lib/](/lib/)

Tests here: [/test/](/test/)

Could have done it more simple but broke it out as I have a feeling we will be using this more later.

Would love any feedback!
